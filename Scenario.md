The Project Scenario


Overview
In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at a bike rental company, helping interpret real-world data to help make a key business decision.

Project Scenario

A bike rental company is looking to improve its demand forecasting accuracy to optimize its fleet management and pricing strategy. They collect data on daily rental transactions and want to use it to predict future demand. 

The company aims to use the forecasts to determine the optimal number of bikes to keep in each station and to set dynamic pricing based on the predicted demand. Making these forecasts will enhance the company's logistic processes, help reduce costs, and maximize profits.

Project Objectives

Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights

Fit well-validated time series models for forecasting future rental bikes demands

Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations

Your Challenge

Your challenge will be to conduct a time series data analysis to forecast future rental bike demands. To do this, you will load, clean, process, analyze, and visualize data. You will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using the dataset provided. In addition, you will build time series models to forecast future demands.

In this project, we'll use a data set containing the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the Capital bike share system in Washington, DC, with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings.
